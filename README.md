# Chatic

This project is a full-stack chat application that enables real-time communication between users.

The front-end of the application is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs), a powerful React framework that supports features like server-side rendering and static website generation. The back-end is developed with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), a JavaScript runtime that enables the creation of scalable network applications.

The application is hosted on two platforms: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for the front-end and [GoogleCloud](https://cloud.google.com/) for the back-end, ensuring robust and reliable performance.

## About the project

The project utilizes a variety of modern technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a statically typed superset of JavaScript, is used to ensure type safety and enhance the development experience.
- [EsLint](https://eslint.org/) for code management is employed for code management, helping to maintain code consistency and avoid potential bugs.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/), a minimal and flexible NodeJS framework, is used for creating the server.
- Real-time chat functionality is achieved with [Socket io](https://socket.io/).
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) is used as the database, with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) serving as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library to manage relationships between data and provide schema validation.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) is used for authorization, security, and endpoint protection.
- The application's styling is done with [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/), a simple, modular, and accessible component library.
