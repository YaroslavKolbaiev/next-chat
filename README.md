# Chatic

This project is a full-stack chat application that enables real-time communication between users.

The front-end of the application is built using NextJS, a powerful React framework that supports features like server-side rendering and static website generation. The back-end is developed with NodeJS, a JavaScript runtime that enables the creation of scalable network applications.

The application is hosted on two platforms: Netlify for the front-end and Google Cloud for the back-end, ensuring robust and reliable performance.

## About the project

The project utilizes a variety of modern technologies:

- TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, is used to ensure type safety and enhance the development experience.
- EsLint is employed for code management, helping to maintain code consistency and avoid potential bugs.
- Express, a minimal and flexible NodeJS framework, is used for creating the server.
- Real-time chat functionality is achieved with Socket io.
- MongoDB is used as the database, with Mongoose serving as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library to manage relationships between data and provide schema validation.
- JWT is used for authorization, security, and endpoint protection.
- The application's styling is done with Chakra, a simple, modular, and accessible component library.
